# Predicting Alzheimer's Using Machine Learning:

![Welcome Image](https://github.com/medamer/Build-Week-2/blob/master/Images/alzheimers.png)

This Project is about using Macine learning to predict Alzheimer's based on results of tests.

* Started with the baseline to check how balanced is the data
* Splited the dataset into Train, Validation and Test sets
* Tryed Linear model (LogisticRegression) and Tree Based Model (RandomForestClassifier) to compare which model works best
* Explained individual predictions with shapley value plots
* Checked our results
